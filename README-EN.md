# AdvCommands
AdvCommands is a plugin project that adds multiple features to traditional Minecraft commands.

## Why This is Needed
There are many things that can be created with traditional Minecraft commands.
Most of them heavily rely on combining the `execute` command, which provides conditional branching, with repeating command blocks.

However, `execute` is somewhat difficult to understand, and the repetitive nature increases complexity while also degrading performance.

This plugin aims to replace these with more intuitive alternatives.

## Getting Started
Install this plugin on a Spigot-based server and start it up. (Please also enable command blocks)

Once started, try executing the command `/advcmd cmd say Hello world`.
This should output `Hello world`. Or at least, we hope it will.
