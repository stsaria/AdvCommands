Boolean values and boolean evaluation

In evaluation, true cases are replaced with `true`, and false cases are replaced with `false`.

The first and second values are abstracted as x and y, or meaningless variables are described as a for explanation purposes.
- Equal to
```
<x=y>
```
- x compared to y...
```
<x<y>
<x>y>
```
- Does variable exist
```
<a?>
```

## Usage Examples

<5=5>
# Is 1 less than 2?

# Is 1 greater than 2?
<1>2>
# Does variable hoge exist?
<hoge?>
```
